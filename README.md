# E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analytics

React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL analytics platform on the **real UCI Online Retail dataset** (UK online retailer, 01/12/2010–09/12/2011, currency **GBP**, ~541k raw rows). Dashboards, RFM, K-Means, Apriori, forecasting and run history all read from backend APIs and persisted results. Nothing is hardcoded.

> **Actual vs synthetic data.** The app only ever shows data you import. `backend/tests/synthetic.py` generates *synthetic* rows used **only by automated tests**; they are never loaded by the app.

## Quick start (Windows, PowerShell)

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 15+ (with `psql` on PATH).

```powershell
# 1. Database (enter the postgres superuser password when asked)
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER bda_user WITH PASSWORD 'change_me';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_bda OWNER bda_user;"

# 2. Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # if blocked: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env              # edit DATABASE_URL if you changed the password
alembic upgrade head                # creates all tables
python -m scripts.import_dataset    # downloads UCI zip, cleans, loads (xlsx: several minutes)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 3. Frontend (second terminal)
cd frontend
copy .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev                         # http://localhost:5173
```

Alternatives: if the download is blocked, get the file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail and run `python -m scripts.import_dataset --file "C:\path\Online Retail.xlsx"`, or upload it on the **Data Import & Quality** page. Then open the Customers, Segmentation, Products and Forecasting pages and click the **Run** buttons (each runs in the background; results are saved).

API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

Tests: `cd backend; pytest -q` (uses a temporary SQLite database, no PostgreSQL needed). Frontend build check: `cd frontend; npm run build`.

## Architecture

```
frontend/ (React, Vite, TS, Tailwind, Recharts, Axios)  --HTTP/JSON-->  backend/app/
  src/pages: Dashboard, Customers, Segmentation,                          api.py        REST routes, pagination, filters
             Products, Forecast, ImportPage, History                      schemas.py    Pydantic validation of run parameters
                                                                          models.py     SQLAlchemy tables (PostgreSQL)
                                                                          services/cleaning.py   validation + cleaning
                                                                          services/analytics.py  RFM, K-Means, Apriori, forecast (pure functions)
                                                                          services/runner.py     import + background run executor
backend/alembic/  migrations      backend/tests/  analytics + API tests      backend/scripts/  import + Spark benchmark
```

Tables: `customers`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `analytics_runs`, `customer_segments`, `association_rules`, `forecasts` with foreign keys, a positive-price check constraint, a unique `(run_id, customer_id)` constraint and indexes on join/filter columns. Credentials come from `.env`.

**Expensive work is never done per request.** `POST /api/runs` stores a run (`pending`), a background task executes it (`running` → `completed`/`failed`) and writes results to PostgreSQL; the UI polls the run and then reads the stored results.

Main endpoints: `GET /api/dashboard/{summary,trends,top-products,countries}`, `GET /api/customers`, `GET /api/rfm/summary`, `GET /api/clusters/latest`, `GET /api/association-rules`, `GET /api/forecast/latest`, `POST /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs[/id]`, `POST /api/import`, `GET /api/import/latest`.

## Preprocessing decisions (all counted in the data-quality report)

| Issue | Decision |
|---|---|
| Exact duplicate rows | Removed (can include genuine repeated scans; documented trade-off) |
| Missing `CustomerID` (~25%) | Rows **kept** for revenue/product/forecast analysis as guest sales; excluded from RFM, clustering and customer counts |
| Cancellations (`InvoiceNo` starts with `C`) | Kept and flagged `is_cancellation`; excluded from revenue, RFM, baskets and forecasts; reported separately |
| Quantity ≤ 0 on a normal invoice, or ≥ 0 on a cancellation | Removed as invalid |
| `UnitPrice` ≤ 0 | Removed (also enforced by a DB check constraint) |
| Non-product codes (POST, D, M, BANK CHARGES, AMAZONFEE…) | Removed from the item table |
| Missing description | Filled from the most frequent description of the same stock code, else `UNKNOWN` |
| Currency | GBP, never converted |

## Algorithms

- **RFM**: Recency = days from last purchase to (last dataset date + 1 day); Frequency = distinct invoices; Monetary = sum of non-cancelled line totals. Each is scored 1–5 by quintile (rank-based to avoid tied bin edges; recency reversed). Rules map R/F scores to nine named segments (Champions, Loyal, Potential Loyalists, New, Need Attention, About to Sleep, At Risk, Can't Lose Them, Hibernating); the rules cover all 25 R/F combinations (unit tested).
- **K-Means**: `log1p` to reduce right skew, `StandardScaler`, k in [2, 8] evaluated by silhouette score (sampled to 5,000 points), best k chosen unless fixed; cluster profiles and a PCA 2-D projection are stored.
- **Market basket**: invoices × products boolean matrix limited to the 150 most frequent products (memory bound), single-item baskets dropped, `apriori` (mlxtend) then `association_rules`, filtered by confidence and lift ≥ 1. Support = share of baskets containing the itemset; confidence = P(B | A); lift = confidence / P(B).
- **Forecasting**: daily GBP revenue (non-trading days are zeros). Chronological split: last 28 days = test. Features are calendar fields plus revenue lags of 28/35/42 days and a 7-day rolling mean shifted by 28 days, so every feature is available at prediction time for horizons up to 28 days (no recursive forecasting, no look-ahead). A `GradientBoostingRegressor` is scored on the test window using a model fitted **only on the training window**; it is then refitted on all history to produce the future forecast. Baseline = seasonal naive (repeat last observed week). Metrics: MAE and RMSE for both. A unit test corrupts test-period actuals and asserts that test predictions do not change.

## BDA concepts covered

Volume/Variety/Veracity (541k rows, dirty transactional data, quality report), ETL pipeline (extract → validate/clean → load), relational storage with indexing, batch analytics with persisted results, unsupervised learning (clustering), pattern mining (association rules), time-series forecasting with leakage control, and an optional scale-out discussion via PySpark.

**Optional Pandas vs PySpark benchmark:** `pip install -r requirements-spark.txt` (needs Java), then `python -m scripts.benchmark_pandas_vs_spark --file "data\Online Retail.xlsx" --scale 10 --repeat 3`. On a single laptop Pandas is normally faster for 0.5M rows; Spark's advantage appears at data sizes that exceed one machine's memory.

## Verification status

See the notes delivered with this project for what was and was not executed in the build environment. Re-run `pytest -q` and `npm run build` on your machine to confirm.

## Known limitations

- Background tasks run inside the API process (adequate for a coursework/local setup; use Celery/RQ for production). Re-importing replaces all data.
- Apriori is limited to the top 150 products and `max_len` 3 to keep memory bounded.
- The .xlsx version of the dataset loads slowly through `openpyxl`; convert to CSV for faster imports.
